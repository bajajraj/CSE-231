#    This assignment focuses on the design, implementation and \
#    testing of a Python program to find the desired value display the \
#    values of given and progeammed functions and also about the lists \
#    and the tuples. It also tests the knowledge about the comma seperated \
#    files(csv), files, lists, tuples,try and except, and their implementaion.
